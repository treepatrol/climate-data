# climate-data-workshop
Contains code from Latimer and FOCAL lab meeting workshops in FQ2024 on accessing climate data 

It includes scripts for manual data wrangling -- useful no matter what you're doing -- plus more specific scripts for accessing PRISM and GridMET data.

We didn't include the data in this repo because it takes up too much space. The prism_library_example script contains commands to download the data so you could do it yourself if you like. Data for this workshop are also available in a box folder: https://ucdavis.box.com/s/j467di1rh2ww9qkmi5ynj1w0x63trlge 
 
If you add this shared Box folder to the filesystem of your Mac laptop, you'll probably find the folder at "/Users/[yourusername]/Library/CloudStorage/Box-Box/ClimateDataWorkshop".

This folder has folders containing some monthly and annual prism data, plus some daily gridmet data, and some example location info (PLSS and seed zones, plus Derek's GPS points). 

08 December 2024 Created a Fork in my Tree Patrol Organization for the purpose of playing with the example code. The plan is to create two forks for the SEKI and YOSE projects once I understand the code and need to make substantial site specific and project specific modifications.
